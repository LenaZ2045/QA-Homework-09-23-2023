Exercise #1

Gradation Type of Testng №1

Quality Standard for the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEPABKq072R0GYYquODLpmOxPT5d0xccSb01DjX8E/edit?usp=sharing link file is
BLOCKER & CRITICAL
When entering this address to the browser it is not openning and sayng that the (Page Not Found)
It gives written expalanation that the (Requested file does not exists)
GRADATON TYPE OF TESTING for this issue:
	-if no other file to replace this link file address is available, BLOCKER/CRITICAL fix it now HIGH priority
	-if other file is available to replace this link file address, BLOCKER/CRITICAL fix it when will have time LOW priority

Gradation Type of Testng №2

I opened this website http://ufo.telran-edu.de:8888 and the bag that clearly pops up in front of your eyes is:
WEBSITE IS NOT SECURE! I suppose that clients are not going to feel safe visiting  and using this website!

The type of testing for GRADATION is 
	-MINOR - it is uncorfortable to use unsecured websites, 
	-and it should be fixed as MIDDLE priority order
	within 8 hours!

Gradation Type of Testng №3

I opened the address link https://www.figma.com/file/97hJZ8pttXwkeAkrYAZXmc/UFO?node-id=0%3A1&t=iajlwc21ZHZGQtiU-0) in the browser
and I noticed that really attracts and pops up into the view is that all the attached uploads pictures are in very little miniature sizes
I would explain this Standard of Quality GRADATION TYPE OF TESTING as:
	-MINOR it is uncomfortable to use zoon in and zoom out until you set comfortable size to view the documents
	-and following the first phrase this bag is MIDDLE priority order to be fixed within 8 hours time frame
